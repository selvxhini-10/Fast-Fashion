      <p class="blog-post-meta">December 15, 2022 by <a href="#">Joy Zhou</a> and <a href="#">Selvahini Kamalarajan</a></p>

        <p>Fast fashion primarily appeals to shoppers due to its affordable and trendy nature. However, the industry is notoriously known for its contribution to a plethora of environmental and ethical issues. Mass-produced cheap, stylish clothing 
        means that more people purchase and discard these clothes as they go out of style and lose quality, as they are not meant to last long-term and are intentionally designed to become obsolete within a time frame. The fashion industry’s business model continues to have numerous ethical 
        and unsustainable implications and significant economic, social and cultural consequences.

        <h4>
          <b>Textile Waste</b>
        </h4>
        
        <p>As fast fashion involves the efficient and cheap production of clothes, consumers will continue to buy newer clothes for each trend seasonality, increasing material waste. The average American now generates 82 pounds of textile waste each year. 
          92 million tonnes of textiles waste end up in landfills of the 100 billion that are produced each year. This means a garbage truck packed full of clothes is disposed of in landfills each second. 85% of all textiles go to dumps each year. According to Earth.Org, up to 134 million tonnes of 
          fast fashion waste may be produced by the end of the decade, given this trend continues. This is largely due to the fact that clothing has lower recycling rates because the low quality of fast fashion clothing and cotton, in particular, is challenging to recycle. Brands also use synthetic fibres like polyester, nylon and acrylic, which take hundreds of years to biodegrade. </p>
       
      <h4>
        <b>Depletion of natural resources</b>
        </h4>
        
        <p>Fast fashion production uses a considerable amount of energy and natural resources. This involves the depletion of non-renewable resources, greenhouse gas emissions, fossil fuel energy usage, water pollution and waste management. With approximately 85% of fast fashion waste and less than 1% of it being recycled, the Quantis International 2018 report found that the three main drivers 
          of the industry’s global pollution results from dying and finishing (36%), the process by which fabric is converted into usable cloth, yarn preparation (36%) and fibre production (15%). These processes are energy-intensive as they require extensive amounts of petroleum and release volatile acids like hydrogen chloride. Fibre production has the largest impact on freshwater withdrawal 
          (water diverted or withdrawn from a surface water or groundwater source) and ecosystem quality due to cotton cultivation. The yarn preparation and fibre production stages have the highest impacts on resource depletion as its based on fossil fuel energy. <br>
    <br> Additionally, leather production requires large amounts of feed, land, water and fossil fuels to raise livestock. The tanning process is among the most toxic in all of the fashion supply chain because the chemicals used to tan leather—including mineral salts, formaldehyde, coal-tar derivatives and various oils and dyes—are not biodegradable and contaminates water sources.

        <h4>
          <b> Water pollution and wastewater </b>
        </h4>
        <p>The fashion industry is one of the largest polluters of clean water and is responsible for 20% of global wastewater. The untreated dyes and chemicals used during production are dumped into rivers, and this dries up water sources and pollutes rivers and streams. Synthetic fabrics in clothes like nylon and polyester contain microplastics, and these contaminants take hundreds of years to 
          biodegrade and pollute the ocean. A 2017 report from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimated that 35% of all microplastics – tiny pieces of non-biodegradable plastic – in the ocean come from synthetic textiles like polyester. Washing fast fashion clothes releases 500, 000 tons of microfibres into the ocean each year, which is the equivalent of 50 billion plastic bottles. 
          When these fabrics are washed or left in the rain, tiny plastics are flushed into our wastewater systems and make their way into the ocean. According to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, emissions from textile manufacturing alone are projected to skyrocket by 60% by 2030. 
          In a documentary released in 2015 called <i>The True Cost, </i>it reveals that the world consumes around 80 billion new pieces of clothing every year, which is 400% more than the consumption twenty years ago. 
          
          <br><p>
  Cotton production is also water-intensive. To further put this into perspective, it takes approximately 20, 000 litres of water to produce 1 kilogram of cotton and 2,700 litres of water to make a t-shirt.
        </p>
        
         <h4>
          <b>Ethical issues</b>
        </h4>
        <p>Many factories in underdeveloped countries lack adequate safety equipment, ventilation and disposals to mitigate their toxic work environment in impoverished countries. They’re often “sweatshops” where workers toil in unsafe and dangerous conditions for unfair wages and long working hours. EcoWatch reports that children are employed for cheap labour in many of these instances. This is a violation 
          of basic human rights. These children and underpaid workers are constantly exposed to the toxic chemicals produced within the factories. As a result, garment workers often face respiratory problems or skin irritations due to the use of hazardous chemicals. <br> <br>Factory accidents are a common occurrence with health and safety violations. For instance, 1,132 workers died, and 2,500 were injured when 
          the Rana Plaza garment factory in Bangladesh collapsed. Despite the safety concerns, workers were forced to return to work because of the pressure exerted by brands like Walmart, Joe Fresh and Children’s Place in the US and Europe. For years, corporations seek countries with the lowest labour standards so garment workers can easily be exploited for cheap labour. Worker exploitation plays an imperative role 
          in the fast fashion industry. In order to offer cheaper clothes, their costs need to be low, and the most effective way to do this is by lowering wages.
