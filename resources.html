          Buy more from sustainable brands. Use sustainable fabrics like silk,
          organic cotton, linen, hemp and lyocell. When shopping, consider
          quality over quantity. Be mindful of whether the manufacturer uses
          sustainable and ethical labour practices. Purchase second-hand
          clothing to be eco-friendlier. Shop local. Wash your clothes
          <i>in a correct manner..</i>.<br />
          <br />
          It's evident that we can work towards solving this issue by taking the
          time to rectify the small mistakes we make in our daily lives. And
          these are tips you most likely hear all the time. <br />
          <br />
          But we don't wish to tell you generic solutions that have little to no
          impact. Instead, we propose an alternative solution — one that
          explores the use of technology and how it can be utilized to minimize
          our waste and reduce our carbon footprint.

              <h4>
                <b>Radio-frequency identification (RFID)</b>
              </h4>

              <p>
                RFID tags are a sort of tracking device that employs radio
                frequency to search for, identify, track, and connect with goods
                and people. They enable users to automatically and securely
                identify and track inventories and assets. RFID advances auto-ID
                technology by allowing tags to be read without line of sight
                and, depending on the kind of RFID, having a read range ranging
                from a few centimetres to over 20 metres.
              </p>
              <p>
                RFID in fast fashion allows merchants to track goods more
                accurately throughout the supply chain, allowing them to make
                more informed decisions and spot issues. When fashion inventory
                is tagged at the moment of manufacture, its journey may be
                followed to a high degree of precision throughout the supply
                chain.
              </p>
              <p>
                RFID tags are classified into two types: passive and active. The
                most prevalent are passive RFID tags, which don’t require a
                direct line of sight to a reader but have a significantly
                limited read range, are smaller in size, and are lightweight.
                Passive RFID tags are excellent for the following applications:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Asset and employee tracking</li>
                <li>Clothing and retail</li>
                <li>Inventory and supply chain management</li>
                <li>Logistics</li>
                <li>Anti-counterfeiting and brand protection</li>
                <li>Pharmaceutical and medical care</li>
                <li>Control of gate and perimeter access</li>
                <li>Travel and entertainment</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Moreover, it is also feasible to scan huge volumes of stock at
                once, simplifying the procedure and providing instantaneous
                data. RFID can also potentially make supply chains more robust
                by disclosing operational flaws. As a result, supply chain
                choices may be made more rapidly and with more precise data to
                back them up.
              </p>

              <p>
                RFID also allows shops to embrace sustainable solutions such as
                fashion rental. When RFID tags are installed on every fashion
                inventory, it is simple to execute returns and even categorize
                returned clothing for cleaning.
              </p>

              <p>
                RFID in fast fashion can also assist in improving a retailer’s
                overall sustainability by boosting stock accuracy. Knowing which
                clothing items are selling and which aren’t allows businesses to
                respond swiftly to customer demand and order just what will
                sell.
              </p>
              <p>
                Inventory loss is a major issue in the fashion industry, but can
                be handled with reliable data. Because RFID technology is so
                accurate, fast fashion businesses can only order what they need
                and be confident that they will not receive out-of-stock
                messages. So, RFID in fast fashion is an amazing retail option
                for firms searching for a low-cost high-return strategy to
                strengthen their ethics and improve their reputation.

              <h4>
                <b>Additional Information</b>
              </h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The usage of radio frequency identification (RFID) in
                  warehouses or retail enterprises can help acquire a more
                  accurate and better understanding of a company’s stock levels.
                  This can potentially save the company from wasting so many
                  products and clothes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Warehouses are also more likely to transport proper items to
                  the correct place and in the exact quantity. So coordinating
                  the fashion products they offer becomes much easier when they
                  deliver items to the proper places and know what’s selling in
                  which regions. So RFID is a fantastic way to use advancements
                  in technology to coordinate product movement.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This not only helps things to move faster between the
                  warehouse and retailers, but it also significantly reduces
                  waste caused by sending products to the wrong location or
                  sending too many products for a merchant to sell profitably.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In addition to RFID, the company can also employ Artificial
                  Intelligence to estimate product quantities. This is more
                  commonly utilized by retailers than by warehouses or fast
                  fashion designers, although it can be used at all stages of
                  production and sales. The company can avoid overstocking by
                  using AI to offer information about the amount of merchandise
                  it feels they will use or require.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The fast-fashion firm can also use AI to identify trends such
                  as where to test new designs and deliver new clothes first,
                  and to analyze sales before shipping to additional stores.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In-store AI alternatives also include viewing what is being
                  tried on but not purchased in the fitting rooms. Those goods
                  may appear attractive on the hanger, but they don’t fit well
                  in reality.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the business is selling quickly out of other clothing items
                  or just specific sizes of particular clothing, they can use AI
                  to help them decide what to order more of, and what to avoid
                  purchasing in the future.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A sizing issue with trendy outfits might also result in a lot
                  of waste since customers will not buy it even though it looks
                  good on the hanger. But with enhanced AI suggestions and
                  systems, including online style guides, the firm can eliminate
                  online returns and the problem of customers ordering the same
                  thing in several sizes, lowering shipping and allowing them to
                  sell items while they are still in style.
                </li>
              </ul>
